## Adding to our Notes

- If you want to add any helpful bookmarks or videos go ahead.

  - All I ask is that we follow the MarkDown style that's already in place.

- My goal with this is to have a large repository of helpful information that can be collaborated on by our group. This file will be on github but I want to make everyone in our group a collaborator.

    - I will also add the reviews so that we can collaborate on answers and understanding together.

    - Add any bookmarks, or notes, videos or functions, that you find helpful in any way.

    - I'm going to make it public so anyone can download from it, the only people who will be able to contribute those of us in the group.
