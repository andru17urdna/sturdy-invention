## Adding to our bookmarks

- If you want to add any helpful bookmarks or videos go ahead.

  - All I ask is that we follow the MarkDown style that's already in place. Currently I only added the stuff for our assessment tomorrow cause MDN is broken.

- My goal with this is to have a large repository of helpful information that can be collaborated on by our group. This file will be on github but I want to make everyone in our group a collaborator.

    - Add any bookmarks, or notes, or functions, that you find helpful in any way.

    - I'm going to make it public so anyone can download from it, the only people who will be able to contribute those of us in the group.
